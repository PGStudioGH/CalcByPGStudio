# CalcByPGStudio

### Description:
My calculator programmed with C++ is a console app (cmd).
This calculator has auto-correction so you don't have to manually correct it.
It's comfortable!
So you can just change the size of window and cursor.
If anything, this is my first application.
Now you can investigate my source code.
With pleasure!
